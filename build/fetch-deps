# Last time I checked (June 4 2018), ffmpeg was not yet buildable on linux from vcpkg.
#
# ffmpeg must be installed from source on ubuntu 16.04, because we need at least version 3.3
# I don't understand why, but I got linker errors when trying to build lib/Video, complaining
# that ffmpeg needed to be built with -fPIC. So then I tried re-running ./configure --enable-pic,
# and then building again, but that didn't help. So eventually I resorted to building the shared
# library only, and that fixed it.
#
# git clone https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git ffmpeg
# cd ffmpeg
# git checkout n3.3.3
# ./configure --enable-pic --disable-static --enable-shared
# make
# sudo make install

# [hint - try vcpkg]
# OpenCV must be installed from source, so that you get an up to date version, and the contrib modules
#vcpkg install opencv[contrib,core,eigen,flann,jpeg,opengl,png,tiff]:x64-windows
# OK.. I just compiled OpenCV from source -- instructions here: https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html
# However, you also need to switch to clang.. so:
# export CC=/usr/bin/clang
# export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++
# cmake -D WITH_CUDA=OFF -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=/home/ben/dev/opencv_contrib/modules -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -D ENABLE_CXX11=ON -D BUILD_LIST=core,features2d,xfeatures2d ..
# make -j
# sudo make install
